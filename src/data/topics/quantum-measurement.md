# Quantum Measurement

In quantum mechanics, measurement is the testing or manipulation of a physical system to yield a numerical result. A key feature of quantum measurement is that it collapses the quantum state. Before measurement, a qubit can exist in a superposition of 0 and 1. Upon measurement, its state is projected onto one of the classical states (either 0 or 1), and it will remain in that state for subsequent measurements. The outcome is probabilistic, determined by the amplitudes of the states in the superposition.
