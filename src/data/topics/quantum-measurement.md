# Quantum Measurement

In quantum mechanics, measurement is the testing or manipulation of a physical system to yield a numerical result. It is the bridge between the quantum world of probabilities and the classical world of definite outcomes.

## Collapsing the Wave Function
A key feature of quantum measurement is that it irrevocably alters the quantum state. This is often called the "collapse of the wave function." Before measurement, a qubit can exist in a superposition of 0 and 1. Upon measurement, its state is projected onto one of the classical states (either 0 or 1).

## Probabilistic Outcomes
The outcome of a measurement is inherently probabilistic. The probability of measuring a particular state is determined by the "amplitude" of that state in the superposition. If a qubit is in state α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, the probability of measuring 0 is |α|² and the probability of measuring 1 is |β|².

## The Observer Effect
Once a measurement is made and the qubit collapses to a specific classical state, it will remain in that state for any immediate subsequent measurements of the same kind. This is a core aspect of the observer effect in quantum mechanics.
