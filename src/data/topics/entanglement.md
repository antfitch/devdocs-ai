# Entanglement

Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others.

## Spooky Action at a Distance
This connection persists even when the particles are separated by a large distance. Measuring a property of one particle in an entangled pair, such as its spin, instantly influences the corresponding property of the other particle. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."

## Creating Entangled Pairs
Entanglement can be created through various processes, such as parametric down-conversion, where a laser beam passes through a crystal, splitting photons into entangled pairs. Controlling this process is fundamental to building quantum computers and networks.

## Applications
Entanglement is a key resource in quantum computing and quantum cryptography. It is used in quantum teleportation, superdense coding, and to create the complex, multi-qubit states necessary for running quantum algorithms.
