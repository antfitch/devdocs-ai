# Decoherence

Quantum decoherence is the loss of quantum coherence. In quantum mechanics, particles' behavior is described by the mathematical representation of their quantum states. The property of superposition of states is what allows qubits to hold more information than classical bits. It is this property that decoherence affects. When a quantum system is not perfectly isolated from its environment, the interactions with the environment cause the system to lose its quantum properties over time.
