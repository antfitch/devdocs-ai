# Decoherence

Quantum decoherence is the loss of quantum coherence. In quantum mechanics, particles' behavior is described by the mathematical representation of their quantum states, which can exist in a superposition. Decoherence is the process by which this "quantumness" is lost.

## Environmental Interaction
Decoherence occurs when a quantum system is not perfectly isolated from its environment. Even tiny interactions with the outside world—like stray photons or electromagnetic fields—can disturb the delicate quantum state and cause the superposition to collapse into a definite classical state.

## The Loss of "Quantumness"
The property of superposition of states is what allows qubits to hold more information than classical bits. It is this property that decoherence affects, effectively turning a qubit into a classical bit and erasing the advantage of quantum computation.

## The Challenge for Quantum Computers
Minimizing decoherence is one of the greatest challenges in building functional quantum computers. It requires extreme isolation from the environment, often involving powerful magnetic shielding and cooling systems that operate near absolute zero.
