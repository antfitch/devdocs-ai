# Shor's Algorithm

Shor's algorithm is a quantum computer algorithm for integer factorization. It was developed in 1994 by the American mathematician Peter Shor. On a quantum computer, to factor an integer N, Shor's algorithm runs in polynomial time, meaning the time taken is polynomial in log N, the size of the integer given as input. This has significant implications for cryptography, as many modern encryption systems rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.
