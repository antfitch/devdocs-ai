# Quantum Circuits

A quantum circuit is a model for quantum computation in which a computation is a sequence of quantum gates, which are reversible transformations on a quantum mechanical analog of an n-bit register. This analogous structure is referred to as an n-qubit register. The circuit diagram represents the sequence of gates applied to the qubits, followed by measurements.
