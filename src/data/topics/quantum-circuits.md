# Quantum Circuits

A quantum circuit is a model for quantum computation in which a computation is a sequence of quantum gates, which are reversible transformations on a quantum mechanical analog of an n-bit register.

## The Model of Computation
This analogous structure is referred to as an n-qubit register. The circuit model is the most common way to represent and design quantum algorithms, providing a clear, step-by-step procedure for quantum computation.

## Circuit Diagrams
The circuit diagram is a visual representation of the quantum computation. Time flows from left to right. Horizontal lines represent qubits, and the boxes on those lines represent the quantum gates being applied to them.

## From Circuit to Result
The process starts with qubits initialized in a known state (usually |0‚ü©). Gates are then applied in sequence to manipulate the qubits' states, creating phenomena like superposition and entanglement. Finally, a measurement is performed on one or more qubits to extract the classical result of the computation.
