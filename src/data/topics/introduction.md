# Welcome to DevDocs AI

This is an interactive, AI-enhanced documentation platform designed to make technical content more accessible, explorable, and intelligent. Our goal is to accelerate your learning and productivity by integrating powerful search, filtering, and AI assistance directly into your workflow.

## How to Use This Platform

You can navigate the application using the tabs on the left sidebar: Docs, Prompts, Ask AI, and Search.

### Browsing and Filtering (Docs Tab)

The **Docs** tab is your primary tool for exploring the documentation. You can use a powerful set of filters to find exactly what you need:
- **View Mode**: Switch between viewing entire **Topics**, individual **Sections**, or just **Samples** (code blocks).
- **Types, Subjects, and Keywords**: Combine filters to narrow down results with precision. For example, find all "How-to" guides related to "Authentication" that mention "API Keys."

### Interacting with the AI (Ask AI Tab)

The **Ask AI** tab is your personal assistant. It has several powerful capabilities:
- **Ask a question**: Type any question into the text box. The AI will search the documentation to find relevant information and provide a direct answer, complete with clickable links to the source documents.
- **Explain selected text**: Highlight any confusing text in the main content viewer, and the AI will provide a clear, simple explanation.
- **Generate code sample**: Highlight text describing a concept, and the AI will generate a functional code snippet to illustrate it.

Your conversation history is saved, so you can easily refer back to previous questions and answers.

### Regenerating Code Examples

Every code block in the documentation includes a **regenerate** button. Clicking this button will ask the AI to generate a new, different code sample that illustrates the same concept, giving you alternative perspectives and examples.
