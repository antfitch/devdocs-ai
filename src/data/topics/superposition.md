# Superposition

Superposition is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. It states that, much like waves in classical physics, any two (or more) quantum states can be added together ("superposed") and the result will be another valid quantum state.

## The Core Principle
Conversely, every quantum state can be represented as a sum of two or more other distinct states. This is not just a mathematical trick; a particle in superposition is truly in all possible states at once until it is measured.

## Mathematical Representation
Mathematically, if |ψ⟩ and |φ⟩ are two valid quantum states, then |χ⟩ = α|ψ⟩ + β|φ⟩ is also a valid quantum state, where α and β are complex numbers. The squares of their magnitudes, |α|² and |β|², represent the probabilities of measuring the system in states |ψ⟩ and |φ⟩, respectively.

## Analogy: A Spinning Coin
A common analogy for superposition is a spinning coin. While it's spinning, it's neither heads nor tails, but some combination of both. Only when the coin lands (the "measurement") does it resolve into a definite state of either heads or tails.
