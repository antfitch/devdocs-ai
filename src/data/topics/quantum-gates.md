# Quantum Gates

In quantum computing, a quantum gate (or quantum logic gate) is a basic quantum circuit operating on a small number of qubits. They are the building blocks of quantum circuits, like classical logic gates are for conventional digital circuits. Unlike many classical logic gates, quantum logic gates are reversible. Examples include the Pauli-X (NOT), Hadamard, and CNOT gates.
