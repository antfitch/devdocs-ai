# Quantum Gates

In quantum computing, a quantum gate (or quantum logic gate) is a basic quantum circuit operating on a small number of qubits. They are the building blocks of quantum circuits, like classical logic gates are for conventional digital circuits.

## Reversibility
Unlike many classical logic gates (such as AND or OR), quantum logic gates are reversible. This means that from the output of the gate, you can always determine its input. This property is a direct consequence of the laws of quantum mechanics.

## Common Gates
Some of the most fundamental quantum gates include the Pauli-X gate (which acts like a classical NOT gate), the Hadamard gate (which creates a superposition of the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states), and the CNOT (Controlled-NOT) gate, which operates on two qubits and is crucial for creating entanglement.

## Building Quantum Circuits
By arranging these gates in a sequence, developers can build complex quantum circuits. These circuits implement quantum algorithms that can perform computations by manipulating the quantum states of qubits in a controlled way.
