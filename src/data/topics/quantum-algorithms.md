# Quantum Algorithms

A quantum algorithm is an algorithm which runs on a realistic model of quantum computation, the most commonly used model being the quantum circuit model of computation.

## A New Kind of Procedure
A classical (or non-quantum) algorithm is a finite sequence of instructions, or a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem, where each step or instruction can be performed on a classical computer. Similarly, a quantum algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, where each of the steps can be performed on a quantum computer.

## Leveraging Quantum Phenomena
Quantum algorithms are designed to exploit quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement to solve problems much faster than classical algorithms. They don't speed up all problems, but for specific tasks, the performance gain can be exponential.

## Famous Examples
The most famous quantum algorithms demonstrate this potential. Shor's algorithm can factor large numbers exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm, posing a threat to modern cryptography. Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for searching unstructured databases.
