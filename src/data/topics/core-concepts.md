# Core Concepts

Understanding these core concepts is crucial for using the Quantum API effectively.

## Qubits
tags: qubits, quantum

A qubit or quantum bit is the basic unit of quantum informationâ€”the quantum version of the classical binary bit physically realized with a two-state device. A qubit is a two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system, one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics.

## Entanglement
tags: entanglement, quantum

Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in such a way that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance.
