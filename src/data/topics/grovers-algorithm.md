# Grover's Algorithm

Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for unstructured search that finds with high probability the unique input to a black box function that produces a particular output value. It provides a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. For a list of N items, a classical search would take O(N) time on average, whereas Grover's algorithm can find the item in just O(âˆšN) time.
