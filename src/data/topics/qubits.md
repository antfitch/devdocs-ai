# Qubits

A qubit or quantum bit is the basic unit of quantum informationâ€”the quantum version of the classical binary bit physically realized with a two-state device. A qubit is a two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system, one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics. Unlike a classical bit, which can be in a state of either 0 or 1, a qubit can be in a state of 0, 1, or a superposition of both.
