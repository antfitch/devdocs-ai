# Qubits

A qubit or quantum bit is the basic unit of quantum information—the quantum version of the classical binary bit physically realized with a two-state device.

## The Quantum Advantage
Unlike a classical bit, which can be in a state of either 0 or 1, a qubit can be in a state of 0, 1, or a superposition of both. This ability to exist in multiple states at once is what gives quantum computers their immense processing power.

## Superposition and Representation
A qubit is a two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system, one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics. Its state is typically represented as a linear combination of its two basis states, |0⟩ and |1⟩.

## Physical Realization
Physically, qubits can be realized in many different ways, such as the spin of an electron, the polarization of a photon, or the energy levels of an atom. The key is to have a controllable two-level system that can be manipulated and measured.
