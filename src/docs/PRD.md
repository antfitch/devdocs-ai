# Product Requirements Document: DevDocs AI

**Version:** 2.0
**Author:** App Prototyper AI

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview
DevDocs AI is an interactive, AI-enhanced documentation platform designed for developers. It provides a unified interface to browse, search, and understand technical documentation. The core of the experience is a powerful AI assistant that can explain complex concepts, answer questions based on the provided documentation, and generate relevant code snippets on demand.

### 1.2. Goal
The primary goal of DevDocs AI is to accelerate developer learning and productivity by making documentation more accessible, interactive, and intelligent. It aims to reduce the time developers spend searching for information and trying to decipher complex technical text by integrating advanced filtering and AI-driven assistance directly into the documentation workflow.

## 2. Target Audience
This platform is intended for software developers, engineers, and data scientists who consume technical documentation to build software, use APIs, or learn new technologies.

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1. Main Application Interface
*   **Layout:** A persistent two-column layout with a primary navigation and filtering sidebar on the left and a main content viewer on the right.
*   **Tab-Based Navigation:** The left sidebar is organized into four distinct tabs:
    *   **Docs:** For browsing and filtering documentation.
    *   **Prompts:** For running predefined questions against the AI.
    *   **Ask AI:** For direct interaction with the AI assistant.
    *   **Search:** For keyword-based searching of all documentation.
*   **Content Source:** Documentation is sourced from local Markdown files located in the `src/data/topics/` directory.
*   **Content Rendering:** The main viewer correctly renders standard Markdown syntax, including headings, lists, code blocks, inline code, bold, italics, and blockquotes. Frontmatter is used for metadata and is not rendered.

### 3.2. Advanced Documentation Filtering (Docs Tab)
*   **Multi-Faceted Filtering:** The "Docs" tab provides a powerful filtering interface allowing users to discover content with precision.
*   **Filter Categories:** Users can filter by:
    *   **View Mode:** Toggle between viewing results as whole "Topics," individual "Sections," or only "Samples" (code blocks).
    *   **Types:** High-level categories like "Get Started," "How-to," and "Concept."
    *   **Subjects:** Specific technical domains like "Authentication," "Circuits," or "Quantum Algorithms."
    *   **Keywords:** Granular tags for detailed filtering.
*   **Interactive Results:** The main content area dynamically updates to show a list of documents or sections matching the selected filters. Results are displayed in expandable accordions.

### 3.3. AI Assistant ("AskMe")
The "Ask AI" tab provides a dedicated interface for interacting with the AI assistant.

*   **Ask a Question:**
    *   The user can type a question into a textarea.
    *   The AI assistant performs a keyword-based search against all documentation to find relevant context.
    *   The AI uses this context to generate a comprehensive answer formatted in Markdown.
    *   The answer includes clickable links (e.g., `[Authentication](doc://authentication)`) that navigate the user directly to the source documents in the main viewer.
*   **Explain Text:**
    *   When a user highlights any text within the main content viewer, they can select the "Explain selected text" action.
    *   The AI returns a simplified explanation of the highlighted concept or code.
*   **Generate Code:**
    *   When a user highlights text, they can select the "Generate code sample" action.
    *   The AI generates a functional code snippet based on the context of the highlighted documentation.
*   **Conversation History:** The results of asking questions are maintained in a scrollable conversation history view.

### 3.4. Code Regeneration
*   **In-Place Regeneration:** Within the main document viewer, every code block has a "regenerate" button.
*   **AI-Powered Variation:** Clicking this button instructs the AI to generate a new, different code sample that illustrates the same concept, providing users with alternative examples.

## 4. User Interface and Experience (UX)
*   **Clean & Modern UI:** The application uses ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS for a modern, clean, and responsive design.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application is usable on both desktop and mobile devices. The sidebar collapses into an off-canvas menu on smaller screens.
*   **Clear State Management:** The UI clearly indicates the active tab and filter selections. Breadcrumbs at the top of the main content area provide clear navigation context.

## 5. Technical Stack
*   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **UI Components:** ShadCN UI
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **AI Integration:** Genkit with Google Gemini
*   **Icons:** `lucide-react`
*   **Fonts:** 'Inter' for body/headlines, `monospace` for code.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Performance:** The application should be fast and responsive, with lazy loading and server components where appropriate.
*   **Maintainability:** Code should be clean, well-organized, and follow React best practices.

## 7. Future Considerations
*   **Live Vector Search:** Implement a real vector database and search mechanism to replace the current keyword search for the "Ask AI" feature to improve accuracy.
*   **Content Management:** Integrate a headless CMS or a more robust system for managing documentation content.
*   **User Accounts & Personalization:** Allow users to save chat history, bookmark topics, or customize their experience.
*   **PRD Maintenance:** Whenever new functionality is added to this product, this PRD must be updated to reflect the changes.
